# Edison-Spatial-Mapping-
Class Project related to spatial analysis of census variables, solar pv installations, and potential of solar rooftop in  Edison, New Jersey, with respect to other municipalities.   


The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of geoprocessing tools such as buffer analysis, spatial joins, dissolve, clip, etc., that I was taught in the class.
Most of the spatial analysis done with GIS was with the angle of exploring the outlook of Solar in Edison compared to other municipalities in Middlesex county. 
Moreover, census variables were also analyzed to see land use changes in Edison with the angle of planning and policy making. 
Most of the data was garnered from New Jersey Department of GIS website, Policymaps, and Census.gov website.
